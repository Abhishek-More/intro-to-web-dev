# Intro to Web Dev Workshop

## Goal

Provide web development beginners with the tools and knowledge to build a full-stack website (both a frontend and backend).

## Covered Material
##### Basic Front-end: HTML / CSS / JS
Learn how to build a frontend using these three technologies.
##### Using Libraries and Services
Speed up workflows and know how to leverage powerful tools written by others.
##### Backend and Databases
Introduction to node and simple data storage.


## How to run
Download the repository onto your local machine. If you are familiar with [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), you can also clone the repository using a command line. The starter code contains an incomplete template, while the final version is the fully completed application. Navigate to the desired directory.

#### Running the frontend
Double click index.html and it should open in your browser. Alternatively, you can also use the [Live Server VSCode Extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

#### Running the backend
Make sure that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed on your computer. Once installed, open a command line prompt and install the necessary dependencies with 

`npm i` 

Then, run the express app with

`node app.js`
